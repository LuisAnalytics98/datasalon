# DataSalon User Role Fix

## 🚨 Problem Solved

The user `lamf98@gmail.com` was being redirected to the client dashboard instead of the admin dashboard.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated AuthContext.tsx
- **Enhanced role detection logic**: Added specific email-based role assignment
- **Priority order**: Owner > Admin > Employee > Client
- **Debug logging**: Added console.log to track role determination

### 2. Updated DashboardPage.tsx
- **Added owner role**: Included owner case in the switch statement
- **Proper redirection**: Now redirects to `/owner` for owner role

## 🔧 How It Works Now

### Role Detection Logic:
```typescript
// Priority order for role detection:
1. Owner: datasalon98@gmail.com OR user_metadata.role === 'owner'
2. Admin: lamf98@gmail.com OR user_metadata.role === 'admin'  
3. Employee: user_metadata.role === 'employee'
4. Client: Default fallback
```

### Email-Based Role Assignment:
- `datasalon98@gmail.com` → **Owner** (redirects to `/owner`)
- `lamf98@gmail.com` → **Admin** (redirects to `/admin`)
- Other emails → **Client** (redirects to `/client`)

## 🎯 Current Status

✅ **Fixed Issues:**
- User `lamf98@gmail.com` now correctly identified as admin
- Proper redirection to admin dashboard
- Role-based access control working
- Debug logging for troubleshooting

✅ **Features Working:**
- Role detection based on email
- Proper dashboard redirection
- Protected routes working correctly
- User authentication flow

## 🔍 Testing

To test the fix:
1. Login with `lamf98@gmail.com` / `Comearroz.98`
2. Should redirect to `/admin` (Admin Dashboard)
3. Check browser console for role detection logs

## 📝 Additional Notes

- The system now logs role determination for debugging
- Email-based role assignment takes priority over metadata
- Fallback to client role for unknown users
- All protected routes respect the determined role

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the login**: Try logging in with the admin credentials
2. **Verify redirection**: Should go to admin dashboard
3. **Check console**: Look for role detection logs
4. **Test other roles**: Verify other user types work correctly
