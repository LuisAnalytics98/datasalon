# DataSalon ProtectedRoute Debug

## 🚨 Problem Identified

The issue is that the `ProtectedRoute` is automatically redirecting users to their specific dashboards based on their role, which means the `DashboardPage` never gets executed.

### **Current Flow:**
1. User logs in successfully
2. AuthContext provides user data with role 'admin'
3. User navigates to `/dashboard`
4. `ProtectedRoute` checks the user's role
5. Since no `allowedRoles` are specified for `/dashboard`, it should render the children
6. But there might be other logic interfering

## 🔍 Debug Information Added

### **ProtectedRoute Logging:**
```typescript
console.log('ProtectedRoute render:', { 
  pathname: location.pathname, 
  user: !!user, 
  loading, 
  allowedRoles, 
  requireAuth 
});
```

### **Role Check Logging:**
```typescript
console.log('User role not allowed, redirecting:', { 
  userRole: user.role, 
  allowedRoles 
});
console.log('Redirecting to:', dashboardPath);
```

### **Children Rendering Logging:**
```typescript
console.log('ProtectedRoute: Rendering children');
```

## 🎯 Expected Console Output

When you navigate to `/dashboard`, you should see:

```
ProtectedRoute render: { pathname: '/dashboard', user: true, loading: false, allowedRoles: [], requireAuth: true }
ProtectedRoute: Rendering children
DashboardPage render: { user: {...}, loading: false }
User found, redirecting based on role: admin
User role details: { role: 'admin', email: 'lamf98@gmail.com', id: '...' }
Redirecting to admin dashboard
Navigation should happen now
```

## 🚀 Testing Steps

1. **Login with lamf98@gmail.com**
2. **Check console for ProtectedRoute logs**
3. **Verify DashboardPage logs appear**
4. **Confirm redirection to /admin**

## 🔧 Potential Issues

### **If ProtectedRoute shows "User role not allowed, redirecting":**
- The route might have `allowedRoles` specified
- Check the route configuration in `App.tsx`

### **If "ProtectedRoute: Rendering children" doesn't appear:**
- There's a condition preventing children from rendering
- Check the loading state and user authentication

### **If DashboardPage logs don't appear:**
- The ProtectedRoute is not rendering children
- There might be an infinite redirect loop

## 📝 Current Status

- ✅ **ProtectedRoute logging**: Added
- ✅ **Role check logging**: Added  
- ✅ **Children rendering logging**: Added
- 🔍 **Testing**: In progress

The debug information should help identify exactly where the flow is breaking!
